# Introduction
Welcome to Java Quickstart! This is a course aimed at **coding bootcamp graduates** who want to learn Java. 

It should take 2 - 4 weeks to complete. By completing this course, you should be able to show up on day 1 of your new job as a Junior Java Developer with enough knowledge of Java to continue (and hopefully accelerate) your learning in a hands-on, professional context. 

# Course Pre-requisites
The course makes the assumption that you already know about:

* Ruby and/or Javascript
* Object-oriented Programming
* Test-driven Development
* Model/View/Controller 

This course is envisaged as a **supplement** to the learning that you should already be doing, as a bootcamp grad who wants to learn Java: Googling, reading StackOverflow, playing around with code samples, going on codewars, taking udemy courses, and so on. 

On this point, Tim Buchalka's [Complete Java Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/java-the-complete-java-developer-course/learn/v4/overview) udemy course is recommended. Tim gives a very thorough introduction to Java, from the ground up, and in doing so has saved a lot of space in this course! If you buy Tim's course, work through it in parallel rather than as prerequiste to this course - dip in and out as you need to understand things. 

By buying Tim's course you can get a 90-day trial license for IntelliJ IDEA, an industry-standard Integrated Development Environment for Java. 

# Course Content
The course has four chapters, as described below. It should take no more than one week to complete each section - though naturally you may go through it at any speed you like.

Please note that **working with databases in Java is not covered by this course**. This would be a complex subject all by itself, and and may merit a separate course in future.

Each chapter contains a `ReadMe` with links to any sub-sections. Every chapter also contains at least one code sample, which you are encouraged to open in IntelliJ IDEA and fiddle around with, so that you can explore the concepts the course introduces in a hands-on way. 

Finally, each chapter contains several 'mini-challenges' and one major challenge. The emphasis is learning by doing - complete these tasks to get the most out of this course.
