# Introduction
Welcome to Java Quickstart! This is a course aimed at **coding bootcamp developers** who want to come up to speed with Java quickly. 

It should take about 4 weeks to complete. By completing this course, you should be able to show up on day 1 of your new job as a Junior Java Developer with enough knowledge of Java to continue (and hopefully accellerate) your learning in a hands-on, professional context. 

# Course Pre-requisites
The course  makes the assumption that you already have knowledge of a few things:

* Ruby and/or Javascript
* Object-oriented Programming
* Test-driven Development
* Model/View/Controller 

Additionally, this course is envisaged as a **supplement** to the learning that you should already be doing, as a bootcamp grad who wants to learn Java: Googling, reading StackOverflow, playing around with code samples, going on codewars, taking udemy courses, and so on. 

On this point, I'd like to recommend Tim Buchalka's [Complete Java Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/java-the-complete-java-developer-course/learn/v4/overview) udemy course. Tim gives a very thorough introduction to Java, from the ground up, and in doing so has saved a lot of space in this course! Additionally, by buying Tim's course you can get a 90-day trial license for IntelliJ IDEA, an industry-standard Integrated Development Environment for Java. 

# Course Content
The course has four chapters, as described below. It is envisaged that it will take about one week to complete each section - though naturally you may go through it at any speed you like.

Please note that **working with databases in Java is not covered by this course**. This would be a complex subject all by itself - and may merit a separate course in future.

Each chapter contains a `ReadMe` with links to any sub-sections. Every chapter also contains at least one code sample, which you are encouraged to open in IntelliJ IDEA and fiddle around with, so that you can explore the concepts the course introduces in a hands-on way. Finally for now, each chapter contains several 'mini-challenges' and one major challenge. Once again, the emphasis is by learning by doing - complete these tasks to get the most out of this course.
