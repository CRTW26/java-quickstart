# Java Quickstart - Introduction

* oriented to people who have completed a web development bootcamp
* enables you to start learning on the job
* should take about 4 weeks to complete

* get Tim Buchalka's udemy course

## Chapters

### [1. Java Basics](https://github.com/oscar-barlow/java-quickstart/tree/master/1-basics)

- statically typed
- many more data structures
- interfaces
- IDE
- exceptions
- ecosystem of libraries is different

Tour of java features -

* Streams
* Static typing

Dealing with dbs is omitted.

Challenge: codewars
 
### 2. Testing

* Testing is split between a runner, and an assertions library
* Will run with JUnit, but use AssertJ's assertions
* For mocking and stubbing, will use Mockito

* examples

- static imports - question...

* Testing an exception

Challenge: Airport in Java. Recap brief.

### 3. Jackson & Lombok

* Huge libraries! Jackson is very useful for serialization and de-serialization into Java objects
* Means you don't have to muck around with JSON

* Lombok adds some convient shortcuts for us.

* Together they allow convenient DTOs

Challenge: get and map over some public data, making an array of dtos

### 4. Spring

* This is a big one. The Spring Framework is huge. 
* Major concept to get your head around is Dependency Injection.
* Additionally, splitting out the service layer

Challenge: battle
