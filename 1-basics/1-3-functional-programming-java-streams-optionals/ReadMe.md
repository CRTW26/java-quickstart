# 1.3 Functional Programming in Java: Streams and Optionals

## Introduction

* Noticed that some common operations in Ruby or JS e.g. selecting, mapping,
  etc are not as simple in Java.
* To do this, you need to use a stream
* What is a stream? Well, there are a lot of not terribly helpful definitions
  out there. For the time being, a stream is something that you can transform
  anything that implements the Collection interface into, and which then
  filter, map, etc
* On a more techincal level, streams add functional programming to java, and
    they are monads (good for a mini challenge)


* examples: foreach, primitive streams, filtering, mapping, summing
