# 1.3 Functional Programming in Java: Streams and Optionals

## Introduction

This section covers two elements of Java that are frankly unintuitive for someone who's done a Ruby/Javascript bootcamp:

1. Streams
2. Optionals

Both are widely used in Java development, and both are elements of *functional programming* in Java, which is why I've grouped them together.

For this section, I've extensively referred to/borrowed from this blog post: [Java 8 Stream Tutorial](http://winterbe.com/posts/2014/07/31/java8-stream-tutorial-examples/) by [Benjamin Winterberg](http://winterbe.com/). You may like to read it also.

### Mini-challenge
What is functional programming? Write a quick defintion for yourself. Don't spend too much time on this.
