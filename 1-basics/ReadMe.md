# Java Basics

## Introduction
The goal of this section is to introduce you to some of Java's features, for you to use as a basis for further self-directed learning.

In brief, these are:

1. Compilation, static typing, and data structures
2. Interfaces
3. Functional programming in Java: streams and optionals
4. Throwing and catching exceptions

There's also a challenge to help you consolidate your knowledge.
