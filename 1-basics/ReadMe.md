# Java Basics

## Introduction
The goal of this section is to introduce you to some of Java's features, for you to use as a basis for further self-directed learning.

In brief, these are:

1. [Compilation, static typing, and data structures](https://github.com/oscar-barlow/java-quickstart/tree/master/1-basics/1-1-compilation-statictyping-datastructures)
2. [Interfaces](https://github.com/oscar-barlow/java-quickstart/tree/master/1-basics/1-2-interfaces)
3. [Functional programming in Java: streams and optionals](https://github.com/oscar-barlow/java-quickstart/tree/master/1-basics/1-3-functional-programming-java-streams-optionals)
4. Throwing and catching exceptions

There's also a challenge to help you consolidate your knowledge.
