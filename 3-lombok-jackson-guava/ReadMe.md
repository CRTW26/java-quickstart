# Lombok, Jackson and Guava

## Introduction
The goal of this section is to show you some commonly-used libraries in Java development 

By the end of this section, you should be able to consume and work with data from a public web API.

The libraries covered are:

1. Lombok
2. Jackson
3. Guava

Huge libraries! Jackson is very useful for serialization and de-serialization into Java objects

* Means you don't have to muck around with JSON

* Lombok adds some convient shortcuts for us.

* Together they allow convenient DTOs

Challenge: get and map over some public data, making an array of dtos
